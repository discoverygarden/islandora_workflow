This is a drupal module to implement a generic workflow around Fedora objects.

It uses an inline xml datastream and rdf to record the state of the workflow and notes associated with the workflow in workflow managed objects.
Acceptable state values: created, in_process(for machine workflow), submitted, approved, published, rejected.

Wheather or not to treat collections as being workflow tracked during ingest is handled in a RESL-EXT relationship:
@todo put relationship here... FALSE and not set will initialy(at least) be functionaly equivalent.

Workflow can be enforced through the use of XACML. There is a settings toggle for this.
This toggle starts a large process, we highly recommend only changing it at install time.

For a user to see the 'My Islandora Work' link they need module permissions and some collection level permission set.
Collection level permissions for users and roles can be set at admin/settings/islandora_workflow_perms.
What happens when a Drupal admin revokes a permission that someone currently has with a collection? 
Please make sure not to do this: remove the workflow perms first to ensure database sync.

How do we recover if Drupal side modifications occurred when Fedora was inactive? Please don't do this, be mindful of fedora's state.

To be able to set user specific permissions without restriction you need to set authenticated user permissions to islandora_workflow_Submitter, islandora_workflow_Editor and islandora_workflow_Manager permissions.
Also, anyone who is to edit other users permissions will need the permission 'access administration pages'.
Do not set the islandora_workflow_Administrator permission for the authenticated user role.
If a user has two levels or more of permissions on the same collection the highest level takes precedence.

For a Drupal user to see the main workflow page they must both have appropriate permissions and have access set to a collection.

To start an object in the workflow call this function from islandora_workflow.inc: islandora_workflow_init_workflow($object_id)
On Dec 2nd 2011 the workflow schema underwent a change.  An update utility is packaged with the module.  An update to the current islandora fedora api will be required now.
